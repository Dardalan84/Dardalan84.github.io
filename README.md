Thank you for visiting. This is a repository to hold projects I've completed for xPRO MIT Full Stack Dev course, collaboration and consulting projects, and projects I've undergone for personal interest or study. This will hold my portfolio webpage and will serve as a way for me to display my growth and creative ability in web development.
